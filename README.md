# Customer Service Chatbot Development for [Frontlett](https://www.frontlett.com/)

In this Project, I developed a customer service chatbot using python, html, css and javascript. 
The chatbot was built by using [google generative AI Gemini Pro Model](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).
Deployment is available at [Frontlett Customer Service Bot](https://nimbou-cloud.onrender.com/)
